I am pleased to share a dynamic project developed by Prodigy Infotech - a Stopwatch with Laps feature using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS! ⏱💻

In this project, we have leveraged the capabilities of these web technologies to create a versatile and user-friendly Stopwatch application, enhanced with the ability to record laps for accurate time tracking. 🕰⏲

🔹 HTML: Used to structure the elements of the Stopwatch and Lap features on the web page.
🔹 CSS: Employed for styling the Stopwatch interface, buttons, and overall visual appeal.
🔹 JavaScript​: Implemented to handle the Stopwatch functionality, lap recording, and precise time measurements.

This project exemplifies the innovative spirit and technical proficiency of our team at Prodigy Infotech, showcasing our expertise in web development and user interface design. 💡💻
